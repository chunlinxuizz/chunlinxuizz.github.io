## Basic
I am a Ph.D. student in computational and theoretical chemistry at Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University.\
## Research interests
My current research interests is to explain the experimental observations about the transport of electron and phonon in organic thermoelectric polymers. My work combines the knowledge of physics, chemistry, computational science, as well as materials science. \
## Selected publications
1. Theoretical Perspective of Enhancing Order in n-Doped Thermoelectric Polymers through Side Chain Engineering: The Interplay of Counterion–Backbone Interaction and Side Chain Steric Hindrance. Nano Letters, 2024, 24, 1776−1783.
