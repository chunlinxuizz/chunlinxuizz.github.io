## Basic
I am a Ph.D. student in computational and theoretical chemistry at the Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University.

## Research Interests
My current research interest is to explain the experimental observations regarding the transport of electrons and phonons in organic thermoelectric polymers. These types of materials usually cannot be treated as perfect crystals due to their soft, large, and complicated structural nature. The complex interactions between electrons, phonons, dopants, and defects make these materials relatively challenging for us to investigate, leaving us with many interesting and unresolved questions. My research combines the knowledge of physics, chemistry, computational science, as well as materials science to try to answer these questions using atomic simulations, which include both quantum and classical mechanical treatments.

## Hobbies
When I am not working, I enjoy watching movies, swimming, and playing ball sports. I also enjoy writing code, especially when there's no rush.
