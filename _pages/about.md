## Basic
I am a Ph.D. student in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at the Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University.

## Research Interests
My current research focuses on elucidating the experimental observations of electron and phonon transport in organic small molecular and polymer semiconductors. Due to their soft and structurally complex nature, these materials often deviate significantly from ideal crystalline behavior. The intricate interplay between electrons, phonons, defects, and dopants poses substantial challenges to their investigation, leaving many intriguing questions yet to be answered. To address these challenges, I integrate knowledge from physics, chemistry, computational science, and materials science, employing multiscale simulations that incorporate both quantum and classical mechanical approaches.

## Hobbies
I enjoy watching movies, swimming, mountain climbing, and playing ball sports. I also enjoy writing codes, especially when there's no rush.
